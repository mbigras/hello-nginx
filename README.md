# Hello NGINX

* Provisions infrastructure with Vagrant, Terraform, and Ansible.
* Creates a tiny NGINX installation
* Illustrates using infrasture as code while using Google Docs for a tutorial style reference

## Working Session

Refer to [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PK7-ShQfXp_ojC1C3_Ys1hCm6aZdbV2avPx3XehzBN0/edit?usp=sharing) for a tutorial style reference.

I like using a different web application like Quip for internal docs instead of going straight to a README because a web application is easier for other people on a team or in an organization to change. After enough people have commented, asked questions, made edits, etc. then the doc can get converted into a more static README.
